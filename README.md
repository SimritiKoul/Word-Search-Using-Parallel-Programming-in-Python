# Word-Search-Using-Parallel-Programming-in-Python
While our interaction with computers and other technology has evolved in the recent years, the main form of communication with a computer still at heart remains by text. Data is still stored in the text format and is being processed by software in this format. Traditionally, word searching is done using serial computing and the performance using a single core is quite limited, hence we would like to implement one of the popular algorithms used of string matching and parallelize it to improve the performance. In computing, approximate string matching (often conversationally stated as fuzzy string searching) is that the technique of finding strings that match a pattern more or less (rather than exactly). the matter of approximate string matching is often divided into 2 subproblems: finding approximate substring matches within a given string and finding wordbook strings that match the pattern more or less. Traditionally, word searching is done using serial computing and the performance using a single core is quite limited, hence we would like to implement one of the popular algorithms used of string matching and parallelize it to improve the performance.
